I am a PhD student in Economics at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/home) interested in international macroeconomics, macro-finance and banking regulation. Particularly, I'm focusing on how financial cycles shape global macroeconomic variables such as exchange rates, capital flows and risk-sharing among countries.

I am also a research and teaching assistant at the Department of Economics.
